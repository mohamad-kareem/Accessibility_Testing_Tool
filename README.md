###  A11Y Mastery is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React JS development framework](https://reactjs.org/). React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building SPA (single web application) and user interfaces or UI components. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.


-This project also uses [Framer-Motion] in order to animate components and add fun transitions between pages.

- The app uses the font ["mono space"](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Audiowide&display=swap) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
